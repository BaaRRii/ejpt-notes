Introduction To Exploitation

- Introduction To Exploitation
    - Exploitation consists of techiniques and tools used to gain initial foothold on a target system
    - Successful exploitation depends on the nature and quality of information gathering and service enumeration
    - Phases
        - Identify vulnerable services
        - Identify and prepare exploit code
        - Gain access (msf, manual)
        - Obtain remote access on target system
        - Bypass AV detection
        - Pivot on to other systems

Vulnerability Scanning 

- Banner Grabbing
    - BG is an information gathering technique 
    - The objective is to identify the service running on a specific port as well as the service version
    - Banner grabbing can be performed with
        - NMAP service detection
        - Connecting to the open port with netcat
        - Authenticating with the service (ssh, ftp, telnet)

- Vulnerability scanning with nmap scripts
    - /usr/share/nmap/scritps
    - Nmap scripts are written in LUA
    - /usr/share/nmap/scritps | grep vuln 

- Vulnerability scanning with Metasploit
    - Searchsploit
    - Search auxiliary modules, scanners, etc

Searching For Exploits

- Searching For Publicly Available Exploits
    - Exploit code can be easily found online, however, it can be dangerous to run 
    - Legitimate databases:
        - Exploit-db
        - Rapid7
        - Packet Storm 

- Searching for exploits with Searchsploit
    - Local database for exploit lookup
    - /usr/share/exploit-db

Fixing Exploits

- Fixing Exploits
    - Fix local IPs and ports
    - Some scipts may have extra requirements

- Cross-compiling Exploits
    - Some scripts may need to be compiled yo a portable executable or binary
    - Cross compiling is the process of compiling code for another platform other than the one performing the compilation
    - Need understanding on how to compile C programs 
    - Mingw-w64 to compile C programs for windows
        - 64 bits:
            - i686-w64-mingw32-gcc ex.c -o exploit
        - 32 bits:
            - i686-w64-mingw32-gcc ex.c -o exploit -lws2_32 
    - gcc to compile C programs for linux
    - exploit-db-bin-sploits for precompiled exploits
